          players" would be the submitted blockchain transaction. Now the transaction is being verified by all other
          peers, or in RPG terms, the other players are looking at the dice and verifying if the number is the same as
          the player said.

        <h3>Waiting for the blockchain event</h3>
        <p>
          Now the players verified the dice roll and are writing down the rolled number, just to make sure all of them
          agree on the rolled number. "Writing down" would be the appended transaction to the block chain. After this
          step, the rolled number is sure to be true because it was verified by multiple peers/players.

        <p>
          This is the final number returned by the VRF. In RPG terms, this number matches what the player said, the
          number on the dice, and the number all the players wrote down. Fair game for all! ðŸŽ‰
